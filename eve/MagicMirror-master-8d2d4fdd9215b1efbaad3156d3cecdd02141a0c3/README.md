We need to sync the web frontend, running in a browser, with a writable
state in the backend. E.g. we want to switch some view using an app or
a hardware button. The server must provide some api for this task.

Next Eve will serve directly the full mongodb layer - security concerns,
anyone?

Frontend contains the web frontend which shall display weather data,
jokes and useful information on the magic mirror.
